\section*{}

In this work, we have identified an ergonomics problem affecting the research and implementation of source-code transformations, especially those that aim to optimize non-functional aspects of compiled programs through extensions to existing compilers.

We hypothesize that this problem is mainly caused by a mismatch between the level of semantics at which compilers operate and at which the source code is expressed, and the operational challenges of extending and maintaining an extension or alternate distribution of existing compilers.

Moreover, we have given an overview of important background concepts and of related contributions in this area of work. Finally, we have proposed a solution to this problem, making use of source-to-source compilation as the technique to drive it, and identified the key validation and evaluation criteria for it.

Throughout the next phases of this work, we will carry out more extensive research into related work, implement our solution, and evaluate it, according to the criteria that have been identified.
